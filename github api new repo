To create a new repository using the GitHub API from PowerShell, you can use the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet. Here's an example:

In this code, replace "your_personal_access_token" with your actual personal access token and "new-repo" with the name you want for your new repository. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account.

Remember to keep your personal access token secure and do not share it with anyone.


$token = "your_personal_access_token"
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "token $token"
}

$uri = "https://api.github.com/user/repos"

$body = @{
    name = "new-repo"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Body $body -Headers $headers -ContentType "application/json"
$response
